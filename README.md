# 📊 Capstone Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Adult Income Dataset

This project is part of my capstone work focused on mastering **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques using the well-known **Adult Income Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to analyze the factors that affect an individual's income level.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `adult.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all the EDA steps
- `adult.data` – Raw dataset
- `adult.names` – Dataset description and column information

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Explore relationships between demographic attributes and income
- Visualize distributions and correlations using Python libraries

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Individuals with higher education levels tend to earn >50K.
- People working longer hours per week generally have higher incomes.
- Certain occupations are strongly associated with higher income.
- Gender disparity is visible in income distribution.
- Features like capital gain and capital loss are highly skewed.

---

## 🔍 Techniques Used

- Z-score based outlier detection
- Correlation heatmaps
- Pairplots and boxplots
- Histograms and distribution plots
- Feature transformation and cleaning

---

## 📌 About the Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- **Instances**: ~32,000+
- **Features**: 14 attributes including age, education, occupation, relationship, hours-per-week, and income label

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome

This project helped strengthen my understanding of:
- Data preprocessing workflows
- Visual analytics
- Feature impact analysis
- Drawing meaningful insights from raw data

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Convert EDA insights into features for machine learning models
- Build classification models to predict income
- Deploy insights as a dashboard using Streamlit or Tableau
